Graph: location vs counts of mean ln_volume


        line graph ln_volume over the years for one 

        
        counts of variant by location



To Do
- [ ] Separate Introduction HTML page
- [ ] Link to image gallery
- [ ] Data Download (maybe ajax?)


UI to implement for phenotypic data
'WHERE' might be implemented by having a number of checkbox options for what to filter by, same with group by
- [ ] Slider for important numeric column like eco volume (query = WHERE X > Y) 
- [ ] Group by Location
- [ ] Checkboxes for year
- [ ] Filter by alive or dead
- [ ] Auxillary If group by, offer additional filters (having x > y)
- [ ] Auxillary Provide option for performing aggregate functions

UI to implement for VCF
- [ ] Slider for allele frequency
- [ ] Slider for quality filtering maybe
- [ ] Textbox for scaffold and maybe position (it's possible multiple SNP's exist per scaffold)


List of CGI forms (queries)
- [ ] Filter the VCF by quality
- [ ] Get VCF individuals (from 2018) that are alive
- [ ] Select average length by location in 2015
- [ ] GRAPH QUERY: get SNP's counts by location 
- [ ] GRAPH QUERY: Group by location and find ecological volume
- [ ] GRAPH QUERY: Group by location Volume over 4 years
- [ ] Get counts of alive and dead by location
- [ ]
